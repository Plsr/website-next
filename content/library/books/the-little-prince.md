As I wanted to get back into reading more after a year of not reading much, I needed something that I can finish decently fast.

While this was a very quick read, it was also one I enjoyed a lot. I haven't had the mental space to make my mind up about
what the book wanted to tell me, but it touched me. I teared up twice and it still is amazing to me that someone wrote some symbols
on a piece of paper ages ago which makes me feel things today.

I think the core part of the book is the prince visiting his neighboring planets. I could see myself in the business man a bit, 
which might be the learning I'm taking from this book.
