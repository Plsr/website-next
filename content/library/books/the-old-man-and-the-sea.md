Being vegan, I did not expect to root for an old dude to kill a bunch of different fish.

A great book about suffering and what its worth in the end.

Some qutoes I liked:

> I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid.” “I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.

> "Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?”

> It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.

> “It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”

> You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.
