The article claims that, in order to be very sucessful with or at something, you will need to
get lucky at some point. While you cannot influence getting lucky, you can increase your sruface
for being lucky.

Aaron makes the point that publishing your work is one of the ways to increase your surface for
luck.

What needs to be done is:

1. Do the work
2. Talk about it

> When a person is truly interested in the thing they’re writing or talking about, their excitement is contagious. Whatever you’re excited about, be excited about it publicly. Whatever you’re curious about, be curious about it publicly. People will want to follow along and you’ll inspire people along the way.

There may be concerns about talking about what you do publicly, but

> Sharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey.

Thinking about this in the grand scheme of things, one could argue it is your duty as a member
of society to share what you know in order to keep it moving forward as a whole.
