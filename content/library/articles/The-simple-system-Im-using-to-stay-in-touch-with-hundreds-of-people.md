Jakob shares the system they use to stay in contact with people they know and get into contact with new people. Heavily inspired by [an article by Derek Sivers.](https://sive.rs/hundreds)

> Every morning I’m getting an email that tells me who I should reach out to today. After I sent the messages, I open Airtable and update the Last Contact column to today’s date. In total, this process takes maybe 15 minutes per day.

This somehow feels "wrong" to me and not how social contacts should work. I have this idea that they should just "come naturally". However, at least for me, this is not the case, so I think using a system like this is actually a good idea.
