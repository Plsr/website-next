Tim Ferris on not complaining:

> It all made perfect sense. Fix the words and you fix the thoughts. Iâ€™m not a negative person, but I wanted to cut out the commiserating most of us use for 30-40% of all conversation

> People want to be around action-oriented problem solvers. Training yourself to offer solutions on-the-spot attracts people and resources.

True, always enjoy to be around people that have a stoic view on live and just deal with situations.
