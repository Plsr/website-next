A tool for queue management:

> I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?

This is something I never really thought about. I guess this could become a part of my flow of reading content - tagging it properly so I know when I have the time and/or energy to dig into it.

I had a similar idea a while back and [started working on it](https://github.com/plsr/cilatl) (had earlier versions that are now delete, I believe the project originated from [my wish to combine instapaper and pinboard](https://www.chrisjarling.com/posts/2018-03-25-a-tale-of-two-bookmarking-services)). Probably stopped because I hit some sort of road block - still seems to be a valid idea and a nice side project though.

> I want to be able to open an interface, type three words, and instantly see results from everything my digital self has interacted with. Emails, years of full-text browsing history, text messages, Slack messages across \*\*all\*\* my organizations, calendar invites and events, books, podcast transcripts I’ve consumed, Twitter and Instagram DMs, PDFs I’ve downloaded, bash commands, videos I’ve seen, my online and offline files, notes, blog post drafts - I really do mean everything.

This would be awesome. I feel we're not far from it, sounds like it is a task that AI will be helpful with.
