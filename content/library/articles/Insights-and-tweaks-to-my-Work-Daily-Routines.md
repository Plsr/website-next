It's been a while since I read "Deep Work", and I totally forgot about the day start and end routines. The days I do them are way more structured, but I think I don't hold myself accountable enough for it.

> The end of day shutdown routine is non-negotiable—it guarantees a smooth transition from work mode to relaxation.

They also have advice for chaotic days (which, to be honest, are the most days when you have young kids)

> On the good days, I take a solid 30 minutes to plan my schedule down to the nitty-gritty. But when chaos strikes on the bad days, I glance at my calendar, block off meeting times, and dive headfirst into urgent tasks. After lunch, I do a quick ‘post-mortem’ assessment, tweak my time blocker, and figure out where to focus my energy for the rest of the day.

I think I'll steal that.
