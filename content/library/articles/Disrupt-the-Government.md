Hotz argues that the government is failing in many infrastructure areas, the one thing it should really be good at.

> You disrupt the government by providing 10x better versions of all of the services that it provides.

and

> The key thing the government is supposed to be able to do is infrastructure. Most of the wealth that we give to the US government no longer goes into that, such that even if you are building decentralized versions, you may be able to outcompete the government.

I think the same statement can be made for Germany, currently.
