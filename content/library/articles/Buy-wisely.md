Steph makes a case to optimize for _cost per use_ when buying things, making it more favorable to buy more durable (yet usually more expensive) things:

> *Cost per use*Â accounts for longevity. Durable and repairable things may cost more upfront, but over time they cost less than things that break and need to be replaced.

It's basically "buy cheap, buy twice", but I never thought this through on an analytical level.
