excerpt: "Thoughts about writing content in form of streams of thoughs or pages"
---

Most content on my site is in stream format: I write it once and then do not come back to it. Works good for log-like entries. It does not work well for opinions (which I tend to change over time) and knowledge (which I tend to acquire more over time). I think it makes sense to orient my site more towards pages.

I want to keep the stream part of the site around (term is stolen from Timo's site) for log-like entries. They could also be the starting point of some pages. However, there is no reason why pages should not be the starting point for pages and then there is just a stream of changes to pages. I don't write too many personal things on here lately anyways.

I'm afraid that moving the main content of my site to pages will again give me the feeling that things need to be polished. Even though the idea of moving to pages should be just the opposite: Write early and iterate on ideas when they involve. Can also have different states displayed on it to communicate its state.

Not sure what the states could be. There are two that I'm certain of:
- Still working on it
- Done

Of course, even if it feels like a note is "Done" today, this can be fals in a week or a year. So these states should not communicate that a page is now set in stone. It should rather comminicate that a page is mostly a rough outline (like this one now is) to the reader. Considering that, pages only need one state, which is "Work in Progress" and can be a small indicator at the beginning of the page.
