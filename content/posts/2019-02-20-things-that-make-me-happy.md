I do a lot of things that make me happy over the course of a day. I'm lucky to be
able to say that I do mostly things I like in a typical day. Yet, I often find
myself forgetting that these things make me happy and I end up in a pursiut of
happiness by consuming and buying things.

I recently read an [interview with DHH on the daily
sotic](https://dailystoic.com/dhh/) in which he talked
about what being wealthy means to him. He noted that most of the things he loves
do not cost a lot of money and that he, because of that, is not afraid to lose all
his money.

Now, I am not wealthy, so I am not afraid of losing all my wealth as well. But this
interview got me thinking about the things I love and how I tend to not notice
the joy they give me, just because I am not paying attention to them.  
I decided to wirte them down, so I don't forget.

- Programming. I really enjoy solving problems and trying to write the best code
  I can. Luckily, this is also my job, so I get to do it for a long period of
  time every day and also get money in exchange for it.
- Riding my bike. I do not own this thing for a long time, but it is probably
  the one thing of everything I have ever posessed that is sparking the most joy
  in me (you knew there was a Kondo reference in here somewhere, didn't you?).
  It keeps me healthy as well. Also, exercise in general.
- Eating. It keeps me alive, and if done right, it also tastes awesome.
- Hanging out and talking with people. I always saw talking as some kind of necessary evil,
  probably because I am weird. But I really enjoy it, if I just focus on it.
- Reading. It keeps me calm and I talk myself into believing that it makes me
  smarter.
- Learning new things. No matter in which area, I just like knowing something I
  did not know yesterday.
- My morning coffee. I recently reduced my coffee intake to just one cup in the
  morning, which makes this one cup really special. It is the best coffee I ever
  had, every day.
- Sleeping. Making room in my day to get enough sleep is making everything in my
  day better. I don't love the process of it, since I am not present for a large
  part of it, but I adore what it gives me.

It's funny though, that I need to force myself to do most of these
activities instead of watching YouTube videos for 6 hours a day.
