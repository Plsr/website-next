It is the last day of the year 2025. It's dark outside as I sit down to write this. Everyone in the house is still asleep. I don't feel like writing this. I'm not in the mood to look back or reflect, nor does it feel like there is much to reflect on.

This was probably the most demanding year in my life so far. Not because many good or bad things happened. It was just demanding in almost every area of my life on any given day. I don't know if this is good or bad. I may know in a year or ten.

There is a good chance that sometime today, someone will ask my how my year was. I worked a lot and I spent a lot of time with my family. Both of those things I enjoy and both are important to me. I'm lucky I got to do both of them so much this year. I'm grateful I was able to make so much progress on both.

I spent a lot of my year on autopilot, mentally. I did not write a lot. I can feel that and I changed that in the last quarter of the year. More journaling, more jotting things down, more publishing rough drafts somewhere in the internet. I need to write to keep my sanity.

Going into a new year always feels like stepping into the unknown. Going into 2026 feels particularly unknown. Tech jobs (and a lot of other aspects of life) began to change drastically throughout 2025 and the speed of change is only going to accelerate. It's absolutely fascinating to witness something like this first hand.

I decided to listen to _The Who_ while writing this. I don't know why, I barely ever listen to them. _Won't get fooled again_ started playing as I finished the previous paragraph. This feels like a good song to end this with.

Happy new Year!
