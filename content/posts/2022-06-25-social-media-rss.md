You know what social media is. You are using it. We both are.
Different people use social media in different ways. Some like to post a lot of things and try to get as many likes for what they post. I used to. My contributions never got many likes though.
One time, when I was in university, one of my photo posts on Tumblr went viral. I remember what a foreign feeling it was to get a notification every few seconds. Then Tumblr banned nsfw content, drifted into irrelevancy and my life progressed about 8 years without any virality except for covid.

I use social media in a consuming way. I used to read a lot of reddit and watch a lot of TikTok. I read as much of twitter as my anxiety could tolerate.
It was not all wasted time, but I assume the amount of meaningful _things_ I got out of the services was 1 out of every 20 bits of content I consumed. This number is not based on any data at all. I will build my entire case on it.

Having a family and a full time job, there is not much time to use social media, because there is always something to do. Water and _things that have to be done_ will find their way. There are three main times when I use social media:

1. The toilet
2. When there is nothing to do for 10 minutes for whatever reason. Don't ask, just take it.
3. Escapism

I have more free time in the evening and on weekends. If there are larger blocks of free time, I use them to _do_ things. Like writing this. But this small list supports my case a lot better.

You cannot improve what you don't measure, Gandhi said. Let's measure: I have sparse free time over the day and 5% of it yield something meaningful.
Now let's improve.

I removed all social media apps from my phone (I don't count messaging apps). Where they were, there are now Instapaper and reeder. I subscribed to a lot of RSS feeds, most of them blogs (the terms fediverse and indieweb exist, they might relate, I do not know). When I sit down on the toilet and open reeder, I have more than 100 items unread at most times. I can then choose one based on session length.

### Finding new Feeds

The current process works like this: Get attention of an article on new site. There are multiple ways on how to, more below. I save said article to Instapaper. If the general vibe of the site appeals to me from the get go, I subscribe immediately. Eventually, I will read the saved article. If I feel like I want to read more of this, I will subscribe to the site.

Feeds are in one of three states:

- Freshly subscribed, finding out how often I read the content there
- Subscribed for a while and liked
- Subscribed for a while but untouched. Will eventually be deleted

Finding feeds gets easier the more you follow. Blogs tend to link to content on other blogs. Click the link, you found a new blog.
In the beginning, I paid more attention to articles friends sent me and subscribed to feeds there. Also, [indieblog.page](https://indieblog.page/)

### Objectively, am I a better human being now?

I don't know.
But do I read more? Yes.
Is the amount of meaningful content I consume on the toilet higher? Definitely.
Additionally, this brings back a lot of memories on how the interned was when I was in school, around 2010.
This alone is worth it.

Here is a list of blogs that I tend to read frequently:
