There's a bunch of different conditions that can cause distress in a baby. Here's an incomplete list:

- Too cold
- Too hot
- Hungry
- Tired
- Full Diaper
- Tummy hurts because there's air in it
- Tummy hurts because a fart isn't coming out
- Tummy hurts because poop isn't coming out
- Tummy hurts, in general
- Joints hurt because they're growing
- Sensory overload
- Progressing what happened during the day

However, they only have one way to communicate: They cry.

It's a little bit like trying to debug a program that's not working, but the only output you get is `Uncaught Error: Error` with no stack trace at all. It's... interesting.

Obviously, this is a shitpost to a degree. But it's also true. While there are nuances that may give you a hint to what's wrong, the only chance you have is trying out things and eliminating possible issues until you find what works[^1]. And the next time, you start over new.

[^1]: Also, if you're thinking "just use StackOverflow" let me tell you: You haven't seen a site of toxic know-it-alls until you browsed some parenthood forums.
