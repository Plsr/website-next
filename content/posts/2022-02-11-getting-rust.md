Got into the Rust programming language over the last few weeks. Since I mostly work with dynamic typed languages, it's
a steep learning curve to get into a static typed language again. I enjoy it a lot though, always liked working with
typescript in the past.  
Started with reading the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) which was pretty theoratical.
Did not make it all the way through as I wanted to have something more hands on. Will probably consult it from time to
time in the future when I stumble across things I don't understand.

For now, started with [https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/) which is a
lot more practical. Also peaked into game dev a few times over the past year, so this is something that really interests me.
