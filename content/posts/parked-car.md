"You can't steer a parked car". I came across this in a video the other day and it resonated a lot with me. [^1]

It's easy to sit around and think about doing something and trying to plan every eventuality. This is a fool's errand, though.  
First, your plans will _never_ just work in life. It just doesn't happen.  
Second, you cannot possibly know what problems and issues could arise on the way, until they do.

The logical thing is to just start moving and figure things out on the way. It's scary to do that at times, so thinking about something is the easy way out for the brain. It will trick you into believing you're doing _something_ because you're thinking about it.

Here's [Nat Eliason](https://blog.nateliason.com/p/40-lessons-from-30-years):

> You find what you like by trying it, not by thinking about it.

And, somewhat related, [my favorite video by Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9VBpbnXhWk) originally from [@farrellybros](https://twitter.com/farrellybros/status/407787314597728256):

> Life is like going the wrong way on a moving walkway. Stand still and you go backwards. Walk and you stay put. Gotta hustle to get ahead.

[^1]: I think it originally stems from a religious context. At least all the sources I found online are from religious websites. The original saying seems to be "God can't steer a parked car". The god part did not resonate with me, so I left it out.
