I enjoy seeing pictures of other peoples' desks, but I rarely upload pictures of my desk myself. It's probably nice to look back over the years on where I worked with wich setup (which I can do, because I have pictures, but I don't have any written documentation on it). Time to change that.

The first one is a little messy (sorry for the cables), because it's a temproary one. I'm only in this room for a month. We're staying with my mother-in-law because we're moving countries. The lease for our Cologne apartment is terminated already, but the new lease only starts in September, so we have a month in between.

A few notes on the setup:

- I didn't bother installing my widescreen monitor for the few weeks. The desk mount is heavy and on the bottom of a box. Not worth the hassle.
- Using a 2021 16" M1 MacBook Pro
- I have this mounted on a cheap Amazon laptop stand and use the Magic Mouse & Magic Keyboard to have at least some sort of posture
- Mostly using the Airpods Max while working
- I started keeping a legal pad on the side of my desk for any temporary notes. I use that a lot more than my Field Notes. The Field Notes have a higher quality, which makes me hesistan of just jotting something in. I want it to look cool.
