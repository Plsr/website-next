I'm currently the onboarding partner for a new team member at work, which means I'm showing them around and are the dedicated person they know they can ask as many questions to as they want. This experience made me think about the other times in life where I did teach people something: The times I worked with less experienced developers, the times I was an assistant at my university and gave courses or the times I wrote about things I learned on this website. It made me realise why I enjoy teaching: Because I always learn something myself.

[SECTION ABOUT HOW THIS IS NOT NEW, MAYBE THE QUOTE HERE AS WELL]

I think there is a distinction to be made between onboarding a person and working with a less experienced person in your field. While both are, at their core, the transfer of knowledge from one head to another, I think onboarding someone is more vague. We all aim to have good documentation, but in every company I've worked in, this was an unreachable goal. Life happens and while in every company I've worked in, people made an effort to document everything, we always fell short of our goal. And I think that's okay. It's a byproduct of a company moving and changing.  
However, that means that the knowledge that is transferred during an onboarding might (at least in parts) be implicit and exist in the heads of people in the team and nowhere else. That makes the process harder for both people involved, since sometimes you can't point to a resource that explains what you talked about. There is a lot of trust involved from the start.

This results in a difference in the type of things I learn as the onboarding part. In general, it's one of the following:  
- The new team member has a question and could not find an answer to it. I know the answer, but could not find documentation of it either. **Documentation is missing and should be added.** (Footnote: this should be done by you directly, because it will be forgotten otherwise)
- The new team member has a question and I can not give an answer that is easy to understand. **I do not fully understand this area myself and may need to look into it.** (I like doing this together with the new team member, it's a nice experience to learn something new together)

When writing things here or working with less experienced people, things are a little different. I never made up a new programming paradigm or created a groundbreaking algorithm. That means in almost every case, there is documentation available for what we are talking about. This means the learning I that happens in this constellation is me learning about holes in my knowledge about certain things.  
It happens that the other person asks a question that I do not know how to answer, either at all or in a satisfying depth (Footnote: in this situation, please admit that you don't know and either come back with something or find the solution together. Do not pretend you know. People will notice and it provides no value to anyone). Writing things down here is more extreme even. If I can't write them down I don't know them. This is what this website is: It's a reference, yes, but it's also always a test of my knowledge and my understanding of things.

This post is no different, by the way. It's me understanding the concept of teaching to learn. There are various quotes in different forms around the concept. I like this one from Joseph Joubert:

> To teach is to learn twice



### NOTES:
- This post itself is me explaining a concept I've heard before but never fully understood to myself: "If you want to fully understand something, teach it" & "If you can't explain it in simple terms, you have not understood it"
- I use "things" a lot in here
- Some of the things placed in parentheses could be footnotes?
