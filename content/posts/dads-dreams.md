Article: https://directadvicefordads.com.au/expecting/do-dads-have-to-give-up-their-dreams/

- summary of the points in the article that made me write this
- I often was afraid that I would need to give up my dreams because of family
- In reality, I now am more productive compared to when I was still alone
- Might be other factors, but I'm sure family as a restricting factor made me a lot more focused and helped me to stop wasting time on things I do not really want to do
  - Example of how I cannot waste the day until 4 p.m. and then just catch up in the evening because that would mean skipping family time
