For the first time in our lives, we ordered a tumble dryer. We tried to get by without one for as long as possible, but with now 4 people in the family (on of which an infant that will pee, poop and puke wherever, whenever) and no dedicated space to hang our clothes to dry other then our living room, there was no longer a practical way around it. Pretty excited for this jump in household technology and (what I assume to be a) steep increase in live quality, tbh.
