Have some bigger things in my mind I'm thinking about currently. Don't want to write about any of them here
at this time. Maybe never will, but propably should.  
Usually, I'm able to make big decisions based on rational points (which I identify by writing a lot) or just by going
with my gut. Neither are helpful currently. I hope that my gut will just do it's thing if I keep the things
in the back of my head for a while.

I enjoy writing these notes, but the process is a little... unhandy. I have to think about a better solution to those
than writing them in vim on my laptop. Not that I mind that, but sometimes I feel like just writing them from my phone.
Should not be too hard to find or write a frontend for that. Just needs git access and then figure out what kind of meta-
data to add to the file. I may tackle that in the next day. Or not. Who knows.
