> For years now — I even want to say for a decade — I’ve joked that my read-later list should be called my read-never list. It’s not even a joke, but an evergreen truth: who reads the articles they save for later? How many of these articles do they even start to read? For both, I’m thinking of a single digit percentage. As far as I’m concerned and if I’m guessing the average of the past ten years or so, I must have started to read 10 to 20% of all my saved articles, and finished reading maybe 20 to 40% of them: that’s what? 2-8% of the total?

I‘m in the same boat. I‘ve been using Instapaper for the past 10 years or so. I save a lot to it, but I only read a small percentage of what I save.

However, I‘m fine with that. I don‘ t have the ambition to have „Instapaper Zero“. At the time of writing this, I have 273 unread items lying around. I‘ll probably never read most of them. But that‘s fine. I open up Instapaper when I want to read something, knowing that I have 273 items stored away that I will most likely find interesting.

This hasn‘t always been the case, but since accepting that I will not read a lot of the things I save for later, using Instapaper has been a lot more fun and felt less like work or something I have to do. Theres a few rules I have for saving, though:

- Only save things I have read a paragraph or two of and would have continued if I had the time. No saving based on interesting headlines.
- No news. By the time I get to read them, they‘re old and not of interest anyways.
