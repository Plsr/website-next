title: First vacation of the year

Tomorrow (or rather today, looking at the time), my first vacation of the year will start, and it is very much needed.

I think I can count the number of days I have not written any code this year on two hands. While it’s been very rewarding in terms of improving my skills, it’s also very exhausting. In my vacation, I will not write any code. I want to focus on reading, writing (I have a few articles that are half done lying around) and photography. I’m sure I will not forget everything I learned over the course of the vacation, so taking a break will be okay.

Also, as a note to my future self: Taking your first vacation of the year in September is a stupid idea.
