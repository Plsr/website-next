I bought a case with a smart keyboard for my iPad today. Did not go with the original Apple one because I could not justify the price and got a Logitech Combo Touch instead. Pretty happy with it so far, typing this note on it. Rationale behind the purchase was giving me the ability to write comfortably without having to use my laptop every time. So far, I like the keyboard and I also like how iPadOS behaves with a keyboard and a touchpad.\
Now, I only have a regular iPad, but I can now sense how people are talking about the iPad replacing their computer.

We watched Room 1408 this evening, because Halloween. I hadn‘t watched it probably 10 years. Funny how the scariest part for me now is the whole story resolving around his daughter. Think I could not have cared less about that 10 years ago. Times have changed.\
Also just learned that there are two endings to the movie and today we watched the ending I didn’t know.
