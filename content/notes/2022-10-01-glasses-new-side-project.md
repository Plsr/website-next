Got my new glasses today. My sight got worse (actually twice as bad since my last eye check), so it was awesome to see so much detail in the distance again. I got used to real life being like a video game where far away textures are blurred. Like, I was actually surprised how sharp things could be.

Started working on a new side project a few days ago to learn some technologies I will be needing in the future but have not worked with yet. It's just a [Hacker News reader](https://github.com/Plsr/next-orange) but its good for learning to not get distracted by needing to write custom backend logic.  
May add an extra devlog for that in the future, since I like writing down what I did (especially after learning about the .plan files ID Software was using back in the 90s), but too tired right now.
