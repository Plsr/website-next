It took me almost exactly three years of the pandemic to get Covid for the first time. We were very cautious during the pandemic and I'm happy we were and I got infected that late. My symptoms were similar to a (very nasty) cold and I'm not sure it would have been that mild with earlier mutations and fewer vaccinations.

I got it on a business trip to Portugal, where a lot of people from different countries were together for a prolonged period of time. I knew it was risky from the beginning and it happened. Can't hide forever, I guess.\

After three years of Covid, there really is not much news to me having it. I basically just wanted to jot this down for my future self as a note.\
\
Since I'm back home, I'm isolating away in my daughters room to not get the family sick. I spend a lot of time on the computer and my wife places food at the door. Basically feel as if I'm 14 again.\
\
My symptoms are gone for a few days now, but my tests just don't seem to get negative. It's day 12 now since I noticed first symptoms. Hope to get out of here soon. Also, my daughter want's her room back.

**Update (16th April)**: I finally tested negative on the evening of the 11th. I experience some fatigue currently, am tired a lot quicker than usual. Focussing is a little harder than usual.
