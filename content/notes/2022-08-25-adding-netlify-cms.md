This morning, I was playing around with ways to add content to this site from my iPad. Since I own an iPad again, I want to take it on tips and would love to util it to write content here.

I’m currently in the process of rewriting this site, which will include adding a CMS, but I won’t be able to finish that until my next trip. So I looked at ways to manipulate git from my iPad (as this is a Jekyll site that is update from GitHub). There is [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) which looks great but requires the purchase of the pro version in order to push changes. For just my single usecase, I could not justify the price.

So I thought about adding Netlify CMS to the current site. This would make it possible to add content on the go easily and also already teach me something about Netlify CMS. Just finished adding it, took me about 30 Minutes in total, which is crayz. Now let’s hope this note actually turns up on the page.
