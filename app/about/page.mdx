# About

Hey, I'm Chris Jarling. I'm a {yearsOld} year old husband and
father of two. I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://gigs.com">Gigs</a>,
the world's first Telecom-as-a-Service (we're hiring). Currently, I'm also acting as
an interm Team Lead, which has been very interesting so far.

If you want to contact me, I'd be stoked to receive and email from
you: [hi@chrisjarling.com](mailto:hi@chrisjarling.com)

In my free time, I like to work side projects or this website and reading other
peoples' websites. I also like reading, taking photographs and learning about a
vast variety of things.

## Me and websites

I've have quite some history with websites. I've switched technology and domains a lot
over the years, but I have been maintaining a personal website or blog for over 10 years
now. I've started to build and maintain a photo blog back in 2011 when I was still in
school (the [wayback machine has some broken records of it](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926161400/http://www.christian-poplawski.de:80/#expand). This is what ultimately got me to do web development and write more.

I've been writing on this website since 2017 (which is 7 years at the time of writing - not bad),
although I have changed the domain name once in 2022 when I got married and took on my
wife's last name.
