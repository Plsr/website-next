We originally wanted to drive a little further and hike through the wetlands in Belgium nearby. Unfortunately, there
seem to be areas where dogs are not allowed at all and other where they might be, depending on who you ask. So we decided to stay on the German side where we know the law.

The hike was shorter and warmer than anticipated, but nice. Not sure if the 1+ hour car ride to there was justified, though.
