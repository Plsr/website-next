I picked up an old hobby of mine that I did not have an serious interaction with in the last couple of years: photography.  
I grabbed my old Nikon D3100 and took a lot of photos over the past few days. I'm very happy with them. I'm not sure what happened between the last time I picked the camera up and now, but I'm a lot more happy with how the photos turn out. Like, I have an image in my head of the situation and I'm not completely there of course, but the image that comes out of it is much closer to how I wanted it to be in contrast to a few years ago. (I've uploaded some of the pictures I took on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@_chrispop))  
Also, the [The gap](https://vimeo.com/85040589) quote from Ira Glass comes to mind.

I enjoyed it so much that I upgraded my camera to a Nikon D7000. Now, this is not exactly a new model, it was actually released right around the time my D3100 was released. But it's an upgrade nontheless. The Sensor feels a lot better, it has a few more Megapixels, an autofocus motor in the body, two SD Card slots and probably some more stuff I don't know about yet.  
Took it out today and really liked it. Also orderd a battery grip for our upcoming trip with the camper van.
