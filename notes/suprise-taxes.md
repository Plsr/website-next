I didn't mean to. I had it in the back of my head for a few months now that I had to do them, but I did not plan on doing them today. I just wanted to check out taxfix and how it feels. Entered some data, then some more, then I was done. Great product design on their part, I guess. 

This is like a surprise gift I gave to myself, because now I don't have to worry about it anymore. What a great day.

Interested to see how far off their calculations are from the actual return. Reviews online seem to be 50/50 on either "I got exactly what they calculated" and "They said I'd get 1k back but I had to pay 800 instead".
