After moving away from Jekyll and Netlify for hosting, that also meant moving away from NetlifyCMS. I could have implemented NetlifyCMS even while hosting this site with Vercel, but it felt weird and I never really was happy with NetlifyCMS.\
It worked and was easy to setup, but it felt a little fiddly around the edges. I now added [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), first only for these notes to try it out. Really interested to see how good it works on mobile devices. For now, let's just hope this note gets through without any trouble.
