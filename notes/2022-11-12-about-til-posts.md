Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about where to store my TIL posts lately. Where they are now, they feel awkward. They stand outside of any larger context, they are neither tagged nor searchable, they are ordered by creation date. But then again, I already have a place for those tiny bits of information that I have been neglecting lately: my [wiki](https://wiki.christianpoplawski.de).

Might be about time to clean and update that.
