First sourdough bread turned out well. Great texture, curst a little hard unfortunately. Will try again on the weekend,
starter should be a little stronger then as well.

Second day without a good sleep. Used to be no problem when I was younger and I can still manage one bad night fairly well,
but a second one just crushed not only my productivity but makes everything I do much harder. Felt like I was drunk for
the better part of the day and am very glad that I did not have to move the car today. Happy to be going to bed now because,
to say it in Jared Dunn's words: The edges of things start to get a little dancy.
