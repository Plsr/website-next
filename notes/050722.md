I'm very happy with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) since I switched from RoamResearch. My only pain point is iCloud Sync.
I originally used that because I wanted to use the iOS app. However, the iOS app is not that great and it turns out I
do not write in there too much on the go. Rather use my notebook. So maybe I'll need to look into other ways of syncing.

Started to set up my first bread dough with my sourdough starter. Can start baking first thing in the morning tomorrow.
More excited about a bread than I though I would be.
