It’s weird. Looking at my life objectively, it’s good. It’s just the „not normal“ life I always wanted to life. It is the kind of life I find inspiring when I learn about others that are living a kind of life like this. This sounds like it is daring and full of craziness. It is not. But I think I do many things different compared to the general society. And I like that.

However, living it day to day feels like a struggle and wrong. I don’t know why that is, because it should not.
