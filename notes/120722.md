Went to the dermatologist today to get two liver spots checked out that looked suspicious. Luckily, no need to worry according to the doctor. I think this was the shortest doctors appointment I had in my life. Was in and out of her office in literally one minute. Must also be the person in my life that has the largest _time spent total/time where I was not wearing a shirt_ ratio.

Public transport in Germany is cursed. It is impossible to rely on it if you want to make it to an appointment on time and not plan an extra 30 minute buffer. Of the last 10 times I used public transport in the city, only one tram was on time and that's likely because it was 11pm.

Started using Doom Emacs today to see how it would fit my workflow and how I would like it. As expected, I love org mode. Navigation is still slow. File editing is no problem thanks to the vim key bindings.
