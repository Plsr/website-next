Today marks the first time of me almost vomiting in the gym.  
Whish I could say it was because of me doing a deadlift with an insane amount of weight, but I think it was just because
I did not eat properly before. Probably did not help that it was the first time in a week and I refused to lower weight.

At least my weight progression is going okay. Weighed in at 69kg today again, so I'm getting closer to 70kg steadily.

Oh, also: Notes are back because I don't know what I want.
