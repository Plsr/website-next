I’ve added a bookmarks section to this site. This happened for two reasons:

1. I wanted to have a bookmarks section for some time now
2. I wanted to see if I could build something CMS-Like myself that would make it easier for publishing content on this site.

Number 1 is rather self-explanatory, so I’ll focus on 2 here. I’ve tried out TinaCMS for these notes in order to make it easier to publish them, from any device. And it surely was a good step in the right direction (it’s a lot better than editing markdown files on my MacBook). \
But while it was an improvement, it also did not feel like the optimal solution. Writing on my phone is not really possible and I have to wait for a deploy to make sure everything worked fine.

Quick sidebar: You might think that publishing on a phone is stupid and nobody wants to do it. I thought so too. But after building a blog based on Notion, it was just so nice and easy to write and publish that I found myself jotting down quick thoughts even from my phone. I want this kind of frictionless process for everything on my site.

So I used the new bookmarks section to try and build a small CMS into my site that I have a lot of control over. It’s build in Next (like the rest of this site) and uses Planetscale & Prisma for all things data and Clerk for user authentication. This is also a stack I wanted to try for some time, so that was even better. Te setup is not perfect currently and I’ll have to do some more tweaking, but it will be enough to get a feel for it.

So I now have three different way of managing content on this site. My OCD is screaming at me, but I’ll endure it in the name of science. Or something.
