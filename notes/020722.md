Finished watching season 4 of Stranger Things. It was absurd at times but I enjoyed every second of it.  
The beginning took over the great humor from the second and third season (especially the dustin-steve-dynamic) but it got dark fast. Felt like it was a lot more gory than the last seasons. Series seems to grow up with the characters.
