My [recent focus on RSS feeds](https://christianpoplawski.de/blog/2022/social-media-rss) lead me to a descend into the indie web. I love how much things there are to discover that I did not know about. Apart from a lot of cool new sites, theres a whole lot of services that I'm looking into:

- [Micropub](https://micropub.net/): Would really like to implement it on this site to make writing notes a little easier and also start logging things like read book, read articles and listened podcast episodes on here. Maybe even more data. Not sure about how much of this I want to publish to the web.
- [Invidious](https://invidious.io/): Trying out replacing the original YouTube frontend with that. So far works great.
- [Nitter](https://nitter.net/): Rarely visit twitter, but when I do it's nice to have more than 1/5th of the screen not covered by sheets that incude me to sign up.
